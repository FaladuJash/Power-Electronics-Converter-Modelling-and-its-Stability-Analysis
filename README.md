This repositry contains my B.Tech Project in Electrical Engineering at IIT Indore which I completed in November of 2024. 

The project was titled "Power Electronics Converter Modelling using Black-Box approach for High-Frequency applications" and it involved using concepts of 
**Control Systems** & **Power Electronics and its Application in Power Transmission**.

Firstly, **PSCAD** was used to create models for basic HVDC systems and for Active/Reactive Power Control of Voltage-Sourced Converters. Then AC and DC scanning blocks were introduced to perform Frequency Sweep
and to create Black-Box Model of the system.

Then, **MATLAB** was used to create White-Box Model of the same system using state-space modelling of the system and create Bode and Nyquist Plots for analysis.

Lastly, **Python** was used to automate PSCAD simulations and recording essential data of admittances and to create Bode plots for Black-Box Model.
